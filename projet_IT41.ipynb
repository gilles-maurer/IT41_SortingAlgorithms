    "\n",
    "In this project, our goal is to learn about different sorting algorithms and how they work. Sorting algorithms are very important in computer science because they help us organize data in many ways, like in databases or search engines. By looking at different algorithms, we can learn about their strengths and weaknesses. This helps us choose the best algorithm for a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we choose to study 6 different sorting algorithms : \n",
    "- Bogosort\n",
    "- Bubble sort\n",
    "- Insertion sort\n",
    "- Selection sort\n",
    "- Merge sort\n",
    "- Quick sort\n",
    "\n",
    "For each algorithm, we will explain what it is used for and how it works. Then, we will study its complexity. After that, we will write code for the algorithm and see how it performs with tests.\n",
    "By the end of this project, we hope to understand these sorting algorithms better and how they can be used in real-life situations."
